      <Emphasis primary>
        The SDGs are not being achieved. Success is held back by severe
        financing constraints facing the developing countries: constraints that
        have been gravely aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in
        Ukraine. The key to achieving the SDGs, besides preserving peace and
        lowering geopolitical tensions, is having a plan to finance them. This
        was emphasized by United Nations Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio
        Guterres in his briefing to the General Assembly on major priorities for
        2022: &ldquo;we must go into emergency mode to reform global
        finance&rdquo; (UN, 2022a).
      </Emphasis>
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      At last year&rsquo;s G20 Summit in Rome (October 30&ndash;31, 2021), the
      leaders of the world&rsquo;s largest economies recommitted to the SDGs:
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      &ldquo;We reaffirm our commitment to a global response to accelerate
      progress on the implementation of the SDGs and to support a sustainable,
      inclusive and resilient recovery across the world.&rdquo;
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Financial constraints faced by developing countries have recently been
      highlighted by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a speech to the
      Atlantic Council in April 2022. Yellen&rsquo;s important words are worth
      quoting at length:
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made great efforts to provide funding to support human
      development, the creation of needed infrastructure, and more recently the
      attainment of climate objectives. Multilateral development banks,
      bilateral official donors and creditors, and growing private-sector
      involvement deserve credit for important achievements. That said, the
      response to date is just not to the scale that&rsquo;s needed.{" "}
      <Italics>
        Experts put the funding needs in the trillions, and we&rsquo;ve so far
        been working in billions
      </Italics>
      . The irony of the situation is that while the world has been awash in
      savings &ndash; so much so that real interest rates have been falling for
      several decades &ndash; we have not been able to find the capital needed
      for investments in education, health care, and infrastructure.
      There&rsquo;s little doubt that there are huge potential returns, both
      human and eventually financial, in equipping billions of people in
      developing countries with what they will need to succeed. Going forward,
      we need to evolve the development finance system, including the World Bank
      and the regional development banks, to our changing world, in particular
      to better mobilize private capital and fund global public goods. However,
      the multilateral development banks alone will never meet the scale of
      financing needed, so we also need to revisit our strategies for making
      capital markets work for people in developing countries.&rdquo; (Atlantic
      Council, 2022)
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      For these reasons, the G20 urgently needs to adopt a Global Plan to
      Finance the SDGs. The basis of the plan would be to significantly increase
      fiscal space in developing countries. The IMF, in particular, should work
      with developing countries to design SDG-based public investment strategies
      and the means to finance them.
    </ReportParagraph>

      Chronic underfinancing of sustainable development
    </ReportHeading>
    <ReportParagraph>
      According to the IMF&rsquo;s World Economic Outlook, low-income countries
      (LICs) constitute 8.4% of the world&rsquo;s population, but currently
      account for less than 1% of the world&rsquo;s investment spending (2019).
      Lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) constitute 42.9% of the
      world&rsquo;s population but account for only 15% of investment spending.
      High-income countries (HICs), by contrast, account for 15.8% of the
      world&rsquo;s population yet account for about half of the world&rsquo;s
      investment spending.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      The LICs and LMICs make up the poorer half of the world (combined they
      equal 51% of the world&rsquo;s population), but they account for only
      around 15% of the world&rsquo;s investments. The UMICs and HICs comprise
      the richer 49% of the world&rsquo;s population, with more than 80% of the
      world&rsquo;s investments. The same discrepancy is found regarding fiscal
      outlays. The LICs and LMICs together account for around 10% of the
      world&rsquo;s fiscal outlays, while the UMICs and HICs account for about
      90%. Annual average fiscal spending per person in the LICs amounted to
      US$133 in 2019 (USD, nominal), not enough to provide universal schooling,
      much less to meet all of the SDGs. The dire shortfall in public outlays is
      why the SDG agenda and the clean-energy transformation are both far off
      track. There is overall a positive and statistically significant
      correlation between total government outlays per capita per year (in USD
      PPP) and the SDG Index Score (Figure&nbsp;1.1). Based on this simple
      correlation analysis, the association between government outlays and SDG
      outcomes is particularly strong among countries that spend relatively
      little. Beyond a certain threshold (approximately US$10,000 PPP per
      capita), the quality of spending and other factors seem to make a bigger
      difference (Table 1.2).

    <ReportHeading>The need for greatly expanded SDG financing</ReportHeading>
    <ReportParagraph>
      The SDSN has identified six investment priorities: areas in which major
      societal &ldquo;transformations&rdquo; are needed to achieve the SDGs
      (Sachs et al., 2019):
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>1. Education and social protection</Emphasis> to achieve
      universal secondary education (SDG 4) and poverty reduction (SDG&nbsp;1)
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>2. Health systems</Emphasis> to end the pandemic and to achieve
      Universal Health Coverage (SDG 3)
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>
        3. Zero-carbon energy and circular economy to decarbonize
      </Emphasis>{" "}
      and slash pollution (SDG 7, SDG 12, SDG&nbsp;13)
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>4. Sustainable food</Emphasis>, land use, and protection of
      biodiversity and ecosystems (SDG 2, SDG 13, SDG 15)
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>5. Sustainable urban infrastructure</Emphasis>, including
      housing, public transport, water, and sewerage (SDG 11)
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>6. Universal digital services</Emphasis> (SDG 9) to support all
      other SDG investments, including online education, telemedicine,
      e-payments, e-financing, and e-government services.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      At the core of each transformation is a large-scale, long-term public
      investment program. The major practical challenge facing developing
      countries is to mobilize the incremental financing needed for these six
      priority areas.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      The need for increased SDG financing to achieve these six transformations
      is by now well established. Several excellent studies, especially by the
      IMF, have identified the scale of financing that developing countries need
      to achieve the SDGs (Senhadji et al., 2021).
      <ReportFootnote
        number="1"
        content="Studies to date have estimated SDG costs for social protection (SDG 1); 
        sustainable agriculture and the end of hunger (SDG 2); universal health 
        coverage (SDG 3); universal education from pre-K to upper secondary 
        (SDG 4); universal access to safe water and sanitation (SDG 6); universal 
        access to sustainable energy for all (SDG 7); universal access to digital tech-
        nologies (SDG 9); sustainable housing and urban infrastructure (SDG 11); 
        comprehensive decarbonization and climate adaptation/resilience (SDG 13); 
        sustainable marine and coastal ecozones (SDG 14); sustainable land use and 
        reforestation (SDG 15); and access of the poor to justice (SDG 16)."
      />{" "}
      The bottom line is clear: there is a sizable SDG financing gap for
      low-income countries (LICs) and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs)
      amounting to several hundred billion dollars per year, perhaps around
      US$500 billion per year. Adding in the needs of upper-middle-income
      countries (UMICs), the incremental financing needs come to more than US$1
      trillion per year.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      While the incremental SDG financing needs are large relative to the
      economies of the developing countries, perhaps 10&ndash;20% of gross
      domestic product (GDP) for many LICs and LMICs, the gap is actually quite
      modest relative to size of the world economy. With gross world product
      (GWP) now at around US$100 trillion, the global SDG financing gap is
      perhaps 1&ndash;2% of GWP. Global saving is currently around 27% of GWP,
      or roughly US$27 trillion per year: incremental financing to the order of
      only 4&ndash;8% of global saving is needed to cover the incremental SDG
      financing needs for approximately 80% of the world&rsquo;s population.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      To facilitate a significant increase of funding for the SDGs, developing
      countries should enter into a new &ldquo;SDG Investment Compact&rdquo;
      with the Bretton Woods institutions, akin to the poverty reduction
      strategy frameworks under the previous MDG agenda. This would offer a
      framework for significant increases of SDG financing in line with
      long-term debt sustainability. The new SDG Investment Compact could be
      launched in conjunction with the IMF&rsquo;s new Resilience and
      Sustainability Trust (RST).
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportHeading>
      Six practical pathways for increased SDG financing
    </ReportHeading>
    <ReportParagraph>
      The incremental public financing required can be mobilized in six major
      ways: (1) increased domestic tax revenues; (2) increased sovereign
      (government) borrowing from international development finance institutions
      (DFIs); (3) increased sovereign borrowing from international private
      capital markets; (4) increased official development assistance (ODA); (5)
      increased funding by private foundations and philanthropies; and (6) debt
      restructuring for heavily indebted borrowers, mainly to lengthen
      maturities and reduce interest rates.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>Increased domestic tax revenues.</Emphasis> The SDGs require
      large-scale public investments: in education, health care, infrastructure
      (green energy, digital access, water and sanitation, transport), and
      environmental conservation. On top of that, government has ongoing
      obligations for social protection, public administration, and other public
      services. The levels of investment needed per year are far greater than
      current revenues collected by developing countries. A&nbsp;typical LIC
      collects 15&ndash;20% of its GDP in revenues, but SDG public investment
      needs can reach 40% of GDP or higher, and public administration adds
      another 5&ndash;10% of GDP to budget needs. In short, most countries
      should increase their public revenues to support needed levels of public
      spending. As a rule of thumb, LICs should aim for at least 25% of GDP in
      government revenues; LMICs for at least 30%; UMICs for at least 35%; and
      HICs for at least 40%.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>
        Increased borrowing from multilateral development banks.
      </Emphasis>{" "}
      Beyond the increase in domestic revenues, the LICs and LMICs need to
      borrow to finance SDG-related investments. The best source of increased
      finance will be the multilateral development banks (MDBs), which were
      created precisely to supply long-term low-interest financing to developing
      countries. The MDBs have the potential to borrow large sums from the
      international capital markets on favorable terms and then to use that
      borrowing to expand lending to developing countries on favorable terms
      (long maturities at low interest rates). The MDBs can leverage their
      paid-in capital base severalfold, so that an incremental US$50 billion of
      paid-in capital each year can support US$250 billion or more in increased
      annual lending. The G20 should work urgently with the MDBs on a strategy
      to multiply their SDG financing.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>Sovereign borrowing on international capital markets.</Emphasis>{" "}
      The LICs and LIMCs should also increase their direct sovereign borrowing
      from international capital markets, especially by floating
      sustainability-themed bonds (including sovereign SDG bonds). Yet the
      amounts and terms of international bond-market borrowing are inadequate.
      The basic reason is this: Not a single LIC, and only three LMICs &ndash;
      India, Indonesia and the Philippines &ndash; currently have an
      investment-grade rating from the international rating agencies, as shown
      in Table 1.1. The consequence is that the terms of sovereign bond-market
      borrowing facing most developing countries are very onerous: short
      maturities at very high interest rates (often 500&ndash;1000 basis points
      above the highest-rated borrowers). The G20 and IMF should undertake a
      series of reforms to unlock private capital flows at much larger amounts
      and on far more favorable terms. This would include a more accurate
      credit-rating system that recognizes the high long-term growth potential
      of the developing countries, and measures to increase the liquidity of the
      global sovereign bond market. We discuss this issue further in the next
      section.

    />
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>Increased ODA.</Emphasis> The donor countries in the OECD
      Development Assistance Committee (DAC) are supposed to give 0.7 percent of
      GNI in ODA, but in 2021 they gave only 0.33 percent (US$179 billion
      ODA/US$54.2 trillion GNI) (OECD, 2021). By reaching the 0.7 target, ODA
      would rise by US$200 billion per year. To increase ODA towards 0.7 percent
      of GNI, it is important to identify additional sources of funding for ODA.
      Two potential new sources are apparent. The first would be a levy on HICs
      and UMICs (upper-middle-income countries) on annual carbon dioxide (CO₂)
      emissions. A levy of US$5/tCO₂ on HICs and US$2.5/tCO₂ on UMICs would
      yield annual revenues of around US$100 billion. The second would be a
      globally coordinated wealth tax on ultra-high-net worth individuals. The
      world&rsquo;s 3,000 or so billionaires have a combined net worth of around
      US$15 trillion. Hence, a 2% wealth tax, assuming no leakage, would
      generate around US$300 billion per year.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>Increased philanthropic giving.</Emphasis> In 2021, Jeff Bezos
      donated US$10 billion into a new Bezos Earth Fund to help finance
      investments in climate change and biodiversity conservation. Mr.
      Bezos&rsquo;s net worth is around 1% of total billionaire net worth
      (roughly US$140 billion out of US$14&nbsp;trillion). Following this model,
      the potential for a massive increase in philanthropic giving for the SDGs
      is vast, and could be mobilized in part by a giving campaign initiated by
      the G20 governments and the United Nations.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>Debt restructuring for heavily indebted countries.</Emphasis>{" "}
      Many developing countries are in a precarious situation regarding debt
      servicing, because they owe not only the interest on the debt, but large
      amortizations of principal as well, with little prospect of routinely
      refinancing the principal. In other words, many countries are facing a
      severe liquidity squeeze. In a few cases, there is also a solvency crisis,
      because the interest service is too high to pay even in the long term. The
      global official development system, especially the IMF, should take steps
      to help developing countries to refinance their debts falling due, so that
      we avoid a new wave of sovereign defaults. It takes years or even decades
      to re-establish a country&rsquo;s creditworthiness after such a default.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportHeading>
      Re-thinking debt sustainability: a conceptual digression
    </ReportHeading>
    <ReportParagraph>
      One of the barriers to SDGs financing is conceptual: the widespread belief
      that sovereign borrowers should avoid building up public debt beyond an
      upper limit of 50&ndash;70% of GDP. This view is shared by the IMF and the
      credit rating agencies. The belief is that debt levels beyond such ratios
      are likely to result in default. This is a hasty over-generalization.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      To understand why, consider briefly a quantitative illustration. Let us
      describe a country&rsquo;s GDP as a function of its capital stock per
      person, K, according to a standard aggregate production function familiar
      in macroeconomic theory. A typical assumption is that the GDP function has
      the Cobb-Douglas form:
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>
        GDP = tfp*K<sup>b</sup>
      </Emphasis>
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Here, tfp (total factor productivity) is a measure of overall productivity
      and the coefficient b is the share of capital in national income.
      Considering capital broadly to include both physical capital and human
      capital (mainly education), the coefficient b is around 0.7.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Net domestic product (NDP) equals GDP minus depreciation of capital, which
      we will take to be 5% per annum. Therefore:
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>NDP = GDP &ndash; 0.05*K</Emphasis>
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      If the country has net international debt, it pays interest to foreign
      creditors, so that net national product (NNP) equals NDP minus the
      interest payments. NNP is the baseline measure of real income of the
      economy, net of depreciation and debt service. We will also assume that
      the international interest rate is 5%. The cost of capital equals 10%, the
      sum of the interest rate and the rate of depreciation:
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>NNP = GDP &ndash; 0.05*K &ndash; 0.05*Debt</Emphasis>
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      For purposes of illustration, we will choose parameter values tfp = 6.8
      and K = US$400,000 in order to mimic a HIC. With this level of capital per
      person, the GDP equals US$57,100 and NNP = US$37,100, with depreciation
      equal to US$20,000. The marginal product of capital (MPK) equals 10%,
      which is also the cost of capital.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Now consider a developing country with K = US$40,000, just one-tenth of
      the HIC capital per person. Assume also that the developing country starts
      with zero international debt. Because of the lower stock of capital per
      person, we can calculate that NNP = US$9,400. A middle-income country such
      as Egypt is roughly in this position. Now, we can determine that its MPK
      equals 20%, rather than 10% as in the HIC. That is, the marginal return on
      investment in the developing country is <Italics>higher</Italics> than
      that of the HIC because of the capital scarcity in the developing country.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Assume that the developing country can borrow internationally at a 5%
      interest rate to increase its capital stock, with all borrowing used to
      augment K. Let D be the debt per person, so that capital stock per person
      with borrowing equals K<sup>NEW</sup> = US$40,000 + D. The new NNP equals:
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>
        NNP<sup>NEW</sup> = tfp*(US$40,000+D)<sup>0.7</sup> &ndash;
        0.05*(US$40,000+D) &ndash; 0.05*D
      </Emphasis>
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      It&rsquo;s now easy to calculate the optimum amount of debt per person in
      order to maximize NNP<sup>NEW</sup>. The answer is that the developing
      country should borrow enough to raise K<sup>NEW</sup>{" "}
      <Italics>to the level of K in the HIC</Italics>. Debt per capita, in other
      words, should equal US$360,000, to increase the capital stock per person
      to US$400,000. The government should therefore borrow an astounding 32
      times its initial GDP and channel it into increased capital per person!
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      By borrowing US$360,000, the country&rsquo;s GDP rises from US$11,400 to
      US$57,100, and its NNP rises from US$9,400 to US$19,100. The borrowing
      country takes on a massive amount of debt, but also enjoys a 5X increase
      in GDP and a 2X increase in NNP after interest payments. In the model,
      this rise in output happens all at once. In the real world, it takes one
      to two generations. Yet the principle is the same: large-scale borrowing
      can finance a dramatic rise in living standards and thereby justify a high
      level of borrowing relative to GDP.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Initially, in the model, the D/GDP ratio reaches 31.5, but after the
      five-fold growth, D/GDP settles at 6.3 (630%). This too seems to suggest
      insolvency by conventional standards, but with the interest rate at 5%,
      the interest servicing is 32% of GDP. That is huge, but in the modeling
      exercise it is a price worth paying to generate a 5X increase in GDP. Of
      course, this is merely a heuristic exercise, as it completely ignores the
      fact that raising 32% of GDP in tax revenues for interest payments would
      by itself create massive economic distortions. A realistic account of
      debt-servicing capacity must take into account not only the marginal
      productivity of investment, but also the ability to service sovereign debt
      through sufficient tax revenues, and the ability to convert GDP into net
      exports.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Still, the essential message remains. LICs and LMICs are capital scarce.
      They have high prospective growth rates and high marginal productivities
      of capital. They should borrow, and borrow heavily, in order to finance a
      broad-based increase in investments on human capital (education and
      health), public infrastructure (power, digital, water and sanitation,
      transport), and environmental protection.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportHeading>
      Removing the barriers to increased capital market flows
    </ReportHeading>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Why don&rsquo;t the international capital markets direct such large
      lending to developing countries, so that they can massively increase their
      capital stocks and achieve rapid development? There are several important
      explanations.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      First, to service heavy debts, the borrowing country has to run a large
      trade surplus to pay its interest abroad. In the illustration, the
      borrowing country would have to run a trade surplus equal to 32% of GDP.
      Many countries borrow abroad but then fail to take appropriate steps (such
      as maintaining a competitive exchange rate) to promote the increase in net
      exports needed to service the increased debts.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Second, the borrowing country needs to collect increased taxes to be able
      to service the increased interest payments. It&rsquo;s not enough for the
      national economy to borrow and grow. The sovereign borrower must take care
      to raise taxes sufficiently to service the higher level of interest
      payments.

    <ReportParagraph>
      Third, an irresponsible sovereign borrower might take on a huge stock of
      debt, but then use the debt for consumption or wasteful investment rather
      than for the kinds of investment really needed to raise national income.
      Therefore, sovereign borrowers must establish reliable and trusted systems
      of public administration, so as to prove that incremental borrowing gets
      translated into incremental, high-quality capital.

    <ReportParagraph>
      Fourth, there are inherent limits to a government&rsquo;s ability to
      rapidly boost capital stock. Most importantly, human capital investments
      require a timescale of a full generation: they must educate today&rsquo;s
      young children so that they can become skilled members of the workforce in
      twenty years time. Such investments therefore need time to come to full
      fruition, and sovereign borrowing should be paced according to the
      timeline of economic growth.

      Fifth, governments often fall into unwanted liquidity crises that prevent
      them from servicing debts even with a growing economy. Typically,
      governments pay not only interest on the debt (as in the illustration) but
      on the principal as well. As the principal is paid down (amortized) it
      should in theory be refinanced with new loans, to keep the debt stock
      constant (or growing with GDP). In practice, governments are often unable
      to refinance debts coming due. Lenders often panic and refuse to supply
      new loans to refinance old debts coming due. If the government loses
      access to new borrowing, it is often pushed into default. At that point,
      the country&rsquo;s credit rating collapses, and a short-term liquidity
      problem quickly becomes a long-term financial crisis!

      This analysis points to three main policy conclusions:
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      First, developing countries can and should take on much larger debts than
      is now considered normal, but to do so, they need to be able to borrow
      long-term at reasonable interest rates.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Second, the IMF and credit-rating agencies need to rethink the current
      rating systems and debt-sustainability indicators to take the future
      economic growth prospects of the developing countries into account,
      thereby revealing a much larger debt servicing capacity than is shown in
      static analyses.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Third, developing countries need to manage their budgets, trade policies,
      and liquid assets so that they can routinely service their external debts
      without fear of a liquidity crisis. Improved credibility and liquidity
      management will be essential to enable LICs and LMICs to tap the
      international capital markets on a much larger scale.

      Next steps towards a global plan to finance the SDGs
    </ReportHeading>
    <ReportParagraph>
      First, the G20 should declare, clearly and unequivocally, its commitment
      to channel far larger flows of financing to developing countries: so that
      they can achieve economic development and meet the SDG targets. Second,
      the G20 should greatly increase the lending capacity and annual flows of
      the MDBs, mainly through greater paid-in capital to these institutions,
      but also through greater leverage of their balance sheets. Third, the G20
      should support other measures as well &ndash; notably increased ODA,
      large-scale philanthropy, and refinancing of debts falling due &ndash; to
      bolster SDG finance for the LICs and LMICs. Fourth, the IMF and the
      credit-rating agencies need to redesign assessments of debt
      sustainability, taking into account the growth potential of developing
      countries and their need for far larger capital accumulation. Fifth,
      working together with the IMF and the MDBs, the developing countries need
      to strengthen their debt management and creditworthiness by integrating
      their borrowing policies with tax policies, export policies, and liquidity
      management, all to prevent future liquidity crises.
