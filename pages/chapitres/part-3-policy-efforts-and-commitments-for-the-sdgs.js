      <Emphasis primary>
        Restoring and accelerating SDG progress requires financing (see Part 1),
        data and statistics (see Parts 2 and 4) and sound and ambitious SDG
        policies and roadmaps. To operationalize the 17 SDGs and 169 targets,
        SDSN and partners promote six SDG Transformations that must be
        implemented in parallel and adapted to local contexts. These include
        quality education (SDG 4); access to good quality and affordable health
        care (SDG 3); renewable energy and a circular economy (SDGs 7, 12, and
        13); sustainable land and marine management (SDGs 2, 14, and 15);
        sustainable urban infrastructure (SDGs 6, 9, and 11); and universal
        access to digital services (SDG 9). Scientific knowledge and networks
        are key to model structural changes over a time horizon of 10&ndash;30
        years, which can inform policy discussions and consultations on the six
        SDG transformations.

      This section discusses efforts made by governments (primarily the
      executive branch) to integrate the SDGs into public policies. The SDG
      Index and Dashboards focus on internationally standardized outcome
      statistics. Due to data gaps and time lags in international reporting,
      national policies and commitments must also be considered in gauging a
      country&rsquo;s efforts to achieve the SDGs. We present an assessment of
      governments&rsquo; efforts to achieve the SDGs, including the 2022 SDSN
      Policy Coordination Survey for the SDGs and the Six&nbsp;Transformations
      Scorecards. For the first time, we also present prototype scores of
      government commitments and efforts in support of the SDGs.

      3.1 Political leadership and policy environment: results from the 2022
      SDSN Policy Coordination Survey for the SDGs
    </ReportHeading>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Every year, SDSN mobilizes its global network of experts to track public
      statements by governments and the strategic use of public practices in
      support of the SDGs. Since 2018, this information has been collected
      through the SDSN survey on national coordination and implementation
      mechanisms at the central/federal level of government. This year&rsquo;s
      survey covers 60 countries (13 more than the 47 covered in 2021) plus the
      European Union, including all countries in the G20 and most OECD members
      as well as many countries with a population greater than 100 million
      inhabitants. The results are presented in Table&nbsp;3.1. Data are
      collected and analyzed in close partnership with SDSN&rsquo;s global
      network, and results are shared with UN Permanent Missions for comments
      prior to publication.

    <ReportParagraph>
      Six years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs in 2015, a
      majority of governments had by 2021 developed strategies and action plans
      to implement the goals. For many governments, this takes the form of a
      national sustainability strategy that is explicitly linked to the 2030
      Agenda goals and targets. Some governments though have preferred to take a
      mainstreaming approach, whereby the SDGs are implemented by each
      government ministry within the scope of its mandate (instead of via an
      overarching national action plan). Our survey is unable to evaluate, in
      practice, political and administrative support for the implementation of
      these strategies, although SDSN has published a detailed analysis of SDG
      integration in recovery and resilience plans within the European Union
      (Lafortune et al., 2021).
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Regarding SDG coordination units and mechanisms: we find that most
      countries have appointed a lead unit or agency responsible for
      coordinating implementation of the SDGs (Figure&nbsp;3.1). Yet less than a
      third of the countries surveyed have located this unit at the center of
      government (offices of the President or Prime Minister, or cabinet
      offices).
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportFigure

      central/federal level of government (February 2022)"
    />
    <ReportParagraph>
      Many countries have also developed strategies for SDG monitoring. 46 out
      of the 61 governments covered in the survey have adapted the SDG framework
      to their context and identified a set of nationally relevant indicators.
      On average, such national sets comprise around 135&nbsp;indicators.
      Several countries have also developed online platforms to report on
      progress towards the SDGs. These efforts to strengthen mechanisms to
      monitor sustainable development are critical to inform SDG interventions.
      Challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic also sparked new innovations
      in monitoring and data collection, which are discussed in Part 4.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Official speeches and government efforts to prepare voluntary national
      reviews (VNRs) are also relevant proxy measures to gauge commitment to the
      SDGs. Over the past 12 months, just over half of the surveyed countries
      have reinforced their commitment to the SDGs in the context of an official
      speech or statement made by the head of state (president or prime
      minister). Since 2016, 187 UN Member States have prepared VNRs &ndash; the
      official government-led process to report on SDG progress, gaps, and
      policy efforts (see Figure&nbsp;3.2). This year, 45&nbsp;countries have
      committed to submitting a VNR, which is comparable to the pre-pandemic
      period. But while some countries are preparing their fourth VNR, six
      countries have still never submitted one &ndash; Haiti, Iran, Myanmar,
      South Sudan, the United States, and Yemen (UN, 2022b).

    <ReportParagraph>
      As in previous years, there is some discrepancy between expressed
      political support for the SDGs and integration of the goals into strategic
      public policy processes, most notably national budgets. About a third of
      the governments surveyed (21 out of 61) mention the SDGs or use related
      terms in their latest official budget document &ndash; no improvement over
      last year. And only half of these include the SDGs in a dedicated section
      of their national budgets or in a dedicated budget line. The other half
      refer to the SDGs only in the general narrative, providing less
      SDG-specific budget allocations. Several countries surveyed do
      specifically refer to the SDGs in their national budget to support both
      domestic SDG implementation (including national health, education, social
      protection, or economic development reforms) and SDG implementation abroad
      (for example, aid allocation or foreign policy).
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      This discrepancy is evident also in COVID-19 recovery plans. Among the 44
      countries with national recovery plans in place, we found that most (26)
      do not refer to the SDGs at all. Only 9 have a COVID-19 recovery plan in
      which the SDGs form a central pillar to guide a sustainable, inclusive,
      and resilient recovery. This aligns with some of the findings from green
      recovery policy trackers (Green Economy Tracker, 2022; O&rsquo;Callaghan
      et al., 2022; Vivid Economics, 2021; Wuppertal Institut and E3G, 2021). As
      countries work to recover from the pandemic, it is important to maintain
      &ndash; and increase &ndash; the focus on achieving the long-term goals
      agreed by the international community in 2015, including the SDGs, the
      2030&nbsp;Agenda, and the Paris Climate Agreement.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      As shown in Figure&nbsp;3.3, G20 countries are on average less ambitious
      than others when it comes to integrating the SDGs into key policy
      processes. Particularly with regards to linking budgets to the goals and
      developing national SDG indicator sets, G20 countries lag behind. As G20
      countries represent two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s population and
      85&nbsp;percent of global GDP, integrating the SDGs into their governance
      systems is particularly important.

    <ReportParagraph>
      Besides the executive branch of government, parliamentary committees and
      groups promoting SDG action have also emerged over the years. For
      instance, the SDG Alliance is an informal group of European Parliament
      Members from different committees and political groups who are mobilized
      around the SDGs. In France in 2022, a Member of Parliament put together a
      comprehensive assessment of the country&rsquo;s SDG gaps and priorities
      (Provendier, 2022). Public participation processes at various levels
      (including regions and cities), whether organized through national
      legislature, citizen assemblies, or councils, can also help to identify
      better policy interventions, build legitimacy, and strengthen ownership of
      SDG actions.

    <ReportHeading>3.2 The six SDG Transformations scorecards</ReportHeading>
    <ReportParagraph>
      The six SDG Transformations provide a detailed framework on which to
      construct integrated strategies for the SDGs (Sachs et al., 2019). They
      can be implemented in every country to help address trade-offs and
      synergies across the SDGs. They can also be used to recover from COVID-19
      and to build back better (Sachs et al., 2020; Schmidt-Traub, 2020).
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      The core of the six Transformations is the recognition that all 17 SDGs
      can be achieved through six major societal transformations, focused on:
      (1) education and skills, (2) health and well-being, (3) clean energy and
      industry, (4) sustainable land use, (5) sustainable cities, and (6)
      digital technologies. All are guided by the twin principles to
      &ldquo;leave no one behind&rdquo; and &ldquo;ensure circularity and
      decoupling&rdquo; (see Sachs et al., 2019 for details, page 3). The six
      Transformations provide an action agenda for government ministries,
      businesses, and civil society.

    />
    <ReportParagraph>
      Building on the work of last year, we present an updated and improved
      version of the SDG Transformation scorecards in this section. Each
      scorecard consists of a collection of headline policy measures to track
      implementation of the SDGs. The scorecards complement the SDG Index, which
      is based on outcome data (for example, poverty rate, life expectancy, and
      CO₂ emissions). At the international level, outcome data tend to present
      significant time lags: they may not adequately reflect the impact of
      transformative policies and investments introduced by governments since
      the adoption of the SDGs, as these often yield results only in the medium
      or longer term. The scorecards focus instead on the enabling legal,
      regulatory, and investment conditions needed to achieve the SDGs and the
      objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      This exercise has several caveats and limitations. First, internationally
      comparable policy trackers and measures (such as laws, regulations,
      investments, and subsidies) tend to be less available than international
      outcome data. They rely on more qualitative methods and require an
      advanced understanding of policy areas and country policies and contexts.
      Generally, more comparable policy trackers and measures are available for
      OECD countries than for others. Second, policy efforts need to be
      interpreted with an understanding of national challenges and contexts (for
      instance, the absence of an advanced cybersecurity policy matters less in
      a country with low internet access and poor digital infrastructure).
      Third, apart from a few exceptions, government pledges and policies do not
      capture their effective implementation. And fourth, fewer internationally
      agreed targets or thresholds for policy measures are defined at the
      international level.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      The rest of this section provides a brief overview of countries&rsquo;
      policy efforts and commitments relating to achieving the six SDG
      Transformations and highlights where more research and policy trackers are
      required to broaden our understanding of national SDG efforts. We present
      detailed results for the G20 countries as well as population-weighted
      averages by geographic region and income group. Detailed information on
      indicator sources and thresholds and results for all 193 UN Member States
      are accessible online at www.sdgindex.org.

      Transformation 1: Education, Gender and Inequality
    </ReportSubheading>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Education builds human capital, which in turn promotes economic growth,
      innovation, decent work, and the elimination of extreme poverty and helps
      overcome gender and other inequalities. Countries must further expand and
      transform education systems. SDG target 4.1 calls for universal access to
      12 years of free primary and secondary education, with at least 9 years
      compulsory.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      The scorecards show that many countries around the world currently fall
      short of this target. To reduce inequalities, governments also need to
      expand social safety nets. These should be complemented by
      anti-discrimination measures (including gender), improved labor standards,
      and measures to end all forms of modern slavery, trafficking, and child
      labor. Investments in research and development will also help to promote
      economic growth, which can contribute to reducing inequalities.

    <ReportSubheading>
      Transformation 2: Health, Well-Being and Demography
    </ReportSubheading>
    <ReportParagraph>
      This Transformation promotes key investments in health and well-being. It
      aligns closely with SDG target 3.8, of achieving universal health coverage
      and ensuring that all people have access to the health services they need.
      In the SDGs, universal health care (UHC) is considered as a target in
      itself but for the purpose of the SDG Transformation scorecards we
      consider UHC as an enabler (input) for greater health outcomes. Even
      before the pandemic, the WHO and other international institutions had
      lamented the slow progress being made towards achieving universal health
      coverage (WHO, 2019). Compared with the rest of the world, a higher
      percentage of people in OECD countries tend to be covered by public or
      mandatory private health insurance, and incidence rates of catastrophic
      out-of-pocket health expenditures are lower &ndash; although there are
      exceptions, including Mexico, Costa Rica, Poland, and the United States.
      The SDGs also call on all countries to strengthen their capacity for early
      warning, risk reduction, and management of national and global health
      risks (SDG target 3.d). The Global Health Security Index, a measure of
      pandemic preparedness, turned out to be a rather poor predictor of
      effective early response to COVID-19, as measured in number of cases and
      deaths (Lafortune, 2020), indicating that there are important factors at
      play which are not yet adequately captured by existing policy trackers.
      Looking ahead, it will be important to define solid international measures
      and monitoring systems to better gauge countries&rsquo; preparedness for
      global health security threats.

    <ReportSubheading>
      Transformation 3: Energy Decarbonization and Sustainable Industry
    </ReportSubheading>
    <ReportParagraph>
      This Transformation aims to ensure universal access to modern energy
      sources, decarbonize the energy system by mid-century (in line with the
      Paris Agreement), and reduce industrial pollution of soil, water, and air.
      Many countries, especially OECD members and high-income countries, have
      made commitments to reaching net-zero emissions by mid-century. Over 130
      countries are signatories to the UN Climate Ambition Alliance and more
      than 50 have anchored their net-zero commitment in a law or policy
      document (Net Zero Tracker, 2022; UNFCCC,&nbsp;2022). However, there
      continues to be a major discrepancy between countries&rsquo; self-declared
      ambitions and their tangible efforts and policies. The Climate Action
      Tracker, an independent scientific analysis of governments&rsquo; climate
      actions, finds that not a single G20 country has adopted a sufficient mix
      of policies and actions compatible with achieving the objectives of the
      Paris Climate Agreement (2022). Many countries continue to provide
      significant subsidies for fossil fuels, undercutting efforts to
      decarbonize the energy system. Countries must also ensure that any
      economic stimulus provided by COVID-19 recovery packages aligns with Paris
      climate objectives and supports the transition to net-zero emissions by
      2050.

      Transformation 4. Sustainable Food, Land, Water, and Oceans
    </ReportSubheading>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Today&rsquo;s land-use and food systems have led to persistent hunger,
      malnutrition, and obesity. They account for a quarter of greenhouse gas
      emissions, over 90 percent of scarcity-weighted water use, most
      biodiversity loss, the overexploitation of fisheries, eutrophication
      through nutrient overload, and the pollution of our water and air. At the
      same time, food systems are highly vulnerable to climate change and land
      degradation. Integrated strategies are needed to make food systems, land
      use, and oceans sustainable and healthy for people.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Efforts to track commitments and objectives on Transformation 4 are
      constrained by the complexity of policies relating to land use, oceans,
      and agriculture and the absence of internationally agreed targets for
      biodiversity and land degradation. The debate continues on the
      &ldquo;30x30&rdquo; target for biodiversity: a proposal to have at least
      30&nbsp;percent of the Earth&rsquo;s surface under conservation status by
      2030. There is concern on whether the target is sufficient, whether the
      global community should instead focus on biodiversity &ldquo;hot
      spots&rdquo;, and how to address potential negative impacts on communities
      living in surrounding areas.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      We consider that for the moment there is no comprehensive tracker or
      headline policy indicators (apart from those related to protected areas)
      available to assess in a meaningful and comprehensive way countries&rsquo;
      commitment and efforts on this Transformation. SDSN has launched the Food,
      Environment, Land and Development (FELD) Action Tracker to examine
      national commitments to achieving sustainable land use, resource
      management, and food systems &ndash; including policies, regulations, and
      investments. A first assessment of the integration of food and land issues
      in the Nationally Determined Contributions of G20 countries showed that
      current commitments and actions are largely insufficient (FOLU and FELD,
      2021).
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportSubheading>
      Transformation 5. Sustainable Cities and Communities
    </ReportSubheading>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Cities and other urban areas are home to around 55&nbsp;percent of
      humanity and account for 70 percent of global economic output. By 2050,
      these shares will increase to 70 and 85 percent, respectively (Jiang and
      O&rsquo;Neill, 2017). The OECD estimates that 105 of the 169 SDG targets
      will not be reached without sufficiently engaging sub-national governments
      (OECD, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic too will likely have lasting impacts
      on urban mobility, land use, and transport systems in developed and
      developing countries alike. Many urban organizations and associations have
      mainstreamed the SDGs into their work programs, including UN-Habitat, the
      United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), C40, the OECD, Local
      Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI), and others.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      By design, Transformation 5 calls for regional and local policy trackers.
      These would notably track efforts at the regional and city level to curb
      urban pollution, increase the affordability of housing, and strengthen
      access to public transport and mobility. Other policy measures could be
      considered as proxies of local government commitment to achieving the
      triple objective of being economically productive, socially inclusive, and
      environmentally sustainable. SDSN is working with local partners to
      strengthen policy frameworks in regions and cities, and to reinforce the
      science&ndash;policy interface at the subnational level.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportSubheading>
      Transformation 6. Digital Revolution for Sustainable Development
    </ReportSubheading>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Artificial Intelligence and other digital technologies are disrupting
      almost every sector of the economy, including agriculture (precision
      agriculture), mining (autonomous vehicles), manufacturing (robotics),
      retail (e-commerce), finance (e-payments, trading strategies), media
      (social networks), health (diagnostics, telemedicine), education (online
      learning), public administration (e-governance, e-voting), and science and
      technology. Digital technologies can raise productivity, lower production
      costs, reduce emissions, expand access, dematerialize production, improve
      matching in markets, enable the use of big data, and make public services
      more readily available. They can also improve resource-use efficiencies,
      support the circular economy, enable zero-carbon energy systems, help
      monitor and protect ecosystems, and assume other critical roles in support
      of the SDGs.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Tracking commitments and efforts towards Transformation 6 remains
      difficult, as countries face very different challenges depending on their
      current level of digitalization. For example, highly connected and
      digitized countries may need to prioritize issues surrounding
      cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and e-government. Less-connected
      countries, however, may first need to focus on ensuring widespread and
      affordable internet access and computer literacy education. So far, we
      have been unable to come up with a reliable framework to gauge
      countries&rsquo; commitments and efforts on Transformation 6 that would
      allow for such distinctions across country contexts. This remains an
      important item on our research agenda at SDSN.

      countries in the 2022 SDG Policy Coordination Survey presented in section

      As discussed earlier in this report, the policy data currently available
      is subject to several caveats and limitations, especially with regards to
      Transformations 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, this year&rsquo;s scores of
      government efforts and commitments should be considered as a pilot and
      interpreted with caution. The methodology and rationale for these scores
      are explained in a separate note that is available on www.sdgindex.org. We
      welcome critical comments and feedback that may help to strengthen future
      iterations of this work.

      This pilot assessment reveals that policy efforts and commitments for the
      SDGs vary significantly across countries, including among G20 countries.
      The United States, Brazil, and the Russian Federation show the least
      support for the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, with the United States being
      among the few UN Member States to have never submitted a VNR. But even in
      these countries, despite low federal or national support for the 2030
      Agenda and the SDGs, notable commitments and efforts can be found at
      subnational levels: in regions, states, metropolitan areas, and cities.
      SDSN has worked, for instance, with associations of metropolitan and
      municipal areas in the United States and Brazil (ICS and SDSN, 2021; Lynch
      et al., 2019). By contrast, Nordic countries and, among G20 countries,
      Germany and Mexico, show more support for the SDGs.

      <Italics>Governments&rsquo; Commitment and Efforts for the SDGs</Italics>{" "}
      scores in relation to national scores on this year&rsquo;s SDG Index.
      Benin and Nigeria, for example, have large gaps in their SDG Index yet
      also earn relatively high scores for their policy efforts. This may help
      them achieve better results in coming years. Interestingly, Benin and
      Mexico have both issued SDG Sovereign Bonds in recent years to scale up
      their sustainable development investments. Establishing the right policy
      frameworks for sustainable development, building on scientific knowledge
      and networks, and connecting these frameworks with discussions on access
      to financing should be major priorities of the international community
      towards restoring and accelerating SDG progress by 2030 and beyond.

      None of the 60 countries included in this assessment attained a score of
      80 or more for their commitments and efforts, indicating that none of them
      has an appropriate set of policies in place to achieve the objectives of
      the 2030 Agenda. Even among the top performers in Europe, the assessment
      made by the Climate Action Tracker considers that the strategies and
      actions of these governments are insufficient to achieve the objectives
      set out in the Paris Climate Agreement. Many of these countries could also
      further connect key instruments, such as the national budget and COVID-19
      recovery plans, with the SDGs. Ambitious and sound national targets,
      strategies, and plans are crucial to turn the SDGs into an action agenda.
