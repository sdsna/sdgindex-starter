        Peace, diplomacy, and international cooperation are fundamental
        conditions for the world to progress on the SDGs towards 2030 and
        beyond.
      </Emphasis>{" "}
      The war in Ukraine and other military conflicts are humanitarian
      tragedies. They also impact prosperity and social outcomes through the
      rest of the world, including exacerbating poverty, food insecurity, and
      access to affordable energy. The climate and biodiversity crises amplify
      the impact of these crises. At the time of this writing in early May 2022,
      the outcome of the war in Ukraine and other military conflicts, but also
      of the health crisis, remain highly uncertain. Yet, it is clear that these
      multiple and simultaneous crises have diverted policy attention and
      priorities away from medium and long-term goals such as the SDGs and the
      Paris Climate Agreement: a shift of focus towards short-term issues that
      threatens to slow down or even stall the adoption of ambitious and
      credible national and international plans but also squeezes available
      international funding for sustainable development. Global cooperation and
      commitment to the bedrock SDG principles of social inclusion, clean
      energy, responsible consumption, and universal access to public services
      are needed more than ever to respond to the major challenges of our times,
      including security crises, pandemics, and climate change. Despite these
      difficult times, the SDGs should remain the roadmap for achieving
      sustainable development by 2030 and beyond.

        For the second year in a row, the world is no longer making progress on
        the SDGs.
      </Emphasis>{" "}
      The average SDG Index score slightly declined in 2021, partly due to slow
      or nonexistent recovery in poor and vulnerable countries. Multiple and
      overlapping health and security crises have led to a reversal in SDG
      progress. Performance on SDG&nbsp;1 (No&nbsp;Poverty) and SDG&nbsp;8
      (Decent Work and Economic Growth) remains below pre-pandemic levels in
      many low-income countries (LICs) and lower-middle-income countries
      (LMICs). This is a major setback, especially considering that before the
      pandemic, over the period 2015&ndash;2019, the world was progressing on
      the SDGs at a rate of 0.5 points per year (which was also too slow to
      reach the 2030 deadline), with poorer countries making greater gains than
      rich countries. Progress on climate and biodiversity goals is also too
      slow, especially in rich countries. Ahead of the heads of state SDG Summit
      in 2023, restoring and accelerating SDG progress in all countries,
      including the poorest and most vulnerable, should be a major priority of
      recovery plans and reforms to the international development finance
      system.

      <Emphasis>A global plan to finance the SDGs is needed.</Emphasis>{" "}
      Achieving the SDGs is fundamentally an investment agenda in physical
      infrastructure (including renewable energy) and human capital. Yet the
      poorest half of the world &ndash; roughly speaking, the low-income
      countries (LICs) and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) &ndash; lacks
      market access to capital on acceptable terms. We highlight five priorities
      towards a global plan to finance the SDGs. <Emphasis>First</Emphasis>, the
      G20 should declare clearly and unequivocally its commitment to channel far
      larger flows of financing to developing countries so that they can achieve
      economic development and meet the SDG targets. <Emphasis>Second</Emphasis>
      , the G20 should greatly increase the lending capacity and annual flows of
      the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), mainly through greater paid-in
      capital to these institutions, but also through greater leverage of their
      balance sheets. <Emphasis>Third</Emphasis>, the G20 should support other
      measures as well &ndash; notably increased ODA, large-scale philanthropy,
      and refinancing of debts falling due &ndash; to bolster SDG finance for
      the LICs and LMICs. <Emphasis>Fourth</Emphasis>, the IMF and the
      credit-rating agencies need to redesign the assessments of debt
      sustainability, taking into account the growth potential of developing
      countries and their need for far larger capital accumulation.{" "}
      <Emphasis>Fifth</Emphasis>, working together with the IMF and the MDBs,
      developing countries need to strengthen their debt management and
      creditworthiness by integrating their borrowing policies with tax
      policies, export policies, and liquidity management, all to prevent future
      liquidity crises.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>
        At mid-point on the way to 2030, policy efforts and commitments
        supporting the SDGs vary significantly across countries, including among
        G20 countries.
      </Emphasis>{" "}
      Ambitious and sound national targets, strategies, and plans are crucial to
      turning the SDGs into an action agenda. Every year, SDSN conducts a survey
      of government efforts for the SDGs, to monitor how the goals are
      integrated into official speeches, national plans, budgets and monitoring
      systems. SDSN also compiles metrics to gauge the alignment of national
      objectives and investments with the Six&nbsp;SDG Transformations. This
      year&rsquo;s pilot score of{" "}
      <Italics>Governments&rsquo; Commitment and Efforts for the SDGs</Italics>,
      compiled for more than 60 countries, reveals that among G20 member states,
      the United States, Brazil, and the Russian Federation exhibit the least
      support for the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs. The United States is among the
      few UN Member States to have never submitted a Voluntary National Review
      (VNR). By contrast, Nordic countries demonstrate relatively high support
      for the SDGs, as do Argentina, Germany, Japan and Mexico (all G20
      countries). Some countries, such as Benin and Nigeria, for example, have
      large gaps in their SDG Index yet also earn relatively high scores for
      their policy efforts. This may help them achieve better results in coming
      years. Interestingly, Benin and Mexico have both issued SDG Sovereign
      Bonds in recent years to scale up their sustainable development
      investments.

        Rich countries generate negative international spillovers notably
        through unsustainable consumption; Europe is taking actions.
      </Emphasis>{" "}
      The 2022 SDG Index is topped by three Nordic countries &ndash; Finland,
      Denmark and Sweden &ndash; and all top 10 countries are European
      countries. Yet even these countries face major challenges in achieving
      several SDGs. The 2022 International Spillover Index included in this
      report underlines how rich countries, including many European countries,
      generate negative socioeconomic and environmental spillovers, including
      through unsustainable trade and supply chains. The European Union has
      called for &lsquo;zero tolerance&rsquo; of child labor and has proposed
      using trade to export European values throughout the world. Several
      instruments and legislations are under discussion in the European Union to
      address international spillover effects in the context of the European
      Green Deal. At the member states&rsquo; level, in 2022, Sweden became the
      first country to announce its intention to set a national target to curb
      imported COâ‚‚ emissions. Ahead of the 2023 SDG Summit, we underline four
      major priorities to curb negative international spillovers generated by
      rich countries: (1) Scale up international development and climate
      finance; (2)&nbsp;Leverage technical cooperation and SDG diplomacy; (3)
      Adopt national targets and instruments to address consumption-based
      impacts on other countries (do no harm); (4) Strengthen monitoring and
      data systems at international, national, industrial, and corporate levels
      covering the full supply chains, and make them an integral part of SDG
      reporting.

        The COVID-19 pandemic forced data providers to innovate and build new
        forms of partnerships; these should be leveraged and scaled up to
        promote SDG impacts by 2030 and beyond.
      </Emphasis>{" "}
      The pandemic led to a massive and sudden shift in demand for timely and
      quality data to monitor the health impacts of COVID-19 and inform policy
      intervention at international and national levels. The health situation
      and lockdowns impacted traditional mechanisms for data collection,
      including traditional face-to-face surveys. Data providers were pushed to
      innovate and modernize their data collection methods and processes,
      notably leveraging mobile and wireless technologies. This was accompanied
      by a sharp acceleration in the use of non-traditional data sources,
      including citizen science, social media, and earth observation data. New
      dynamic dashboards, GIS instruments, and improved data visualizations and
      infographics have facilitated a greater understanding of data and
      statistics. Looking ahead, consolidating and scaling-up data innovations
      and new forms of partnerships &ndash; including between the public and
      private sectors (including technology providers) &ndash; while also
      maintaining high standards for data quality and privacy, could help to
      promote evidence-based SDG policies and interventions. More generally,
      science, technological innovations, and data systems can help identify
      solutions in times of crises and can provide decisive contributions to
      address the major challenges of our times. These require increased and
      prolonged investments in statistical capacities, R&amp;D, and education
      and skills.
