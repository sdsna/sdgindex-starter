      At the halfway point, and aware of the remaining challenges to achieve the
      Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Government of Benin asked the UN
      Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) to support it in the
      monitoring and evaluation of the 2030 Agenda. This initial report presents
      an evaluation of Benin&rsquo;s current performance and trends on the SDGs,
      as well as an analysis of its policies to achieve them through
      SDSN&rsquo;s &ldquo;Six Transformations&rdquo; framework (Sachs et al,
      2019). This report serves as a baseline following the first issue of the
      SDG Eurobond by the Government of Benin in July 2021, which demonstrates
      their strong commitment to accelerate the implementation of the 2030
      Agenda.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      The key findings of this initial baseline report are the following:
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      &bull; Benin is halfway to achieving the SDGs with a score of 50.7 out of
      100 across all 17 SDGs.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      &bull; Benin stands out from the rest of the Economic Community of West
      African States (ECOWAS) with progress on SDGs 2 (Zero hunger), 8 (Decent
      work and economic growth), 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and
      14 (Life below Water) since 2015, for which the majority of countries in
      the sub-region are stagnating or even regressing.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      &bull; Compared to higher income countries, Benin performs relatively well
      on SDGs 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and 13 (Climate
      Action).
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      &bull; There are persistent challenges to achieving the majority of the
      SDGs in the region. In particular, the trends for SDGs 4 (Quality
      Education), 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and 11 (Sustainable Cities and
      Communities) must be monitored and reversed.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      &bull; At the subnational level, the &ldquo;leave no one behind&rdquo;
      index covers the following four dimensions: inequalities in access to
      public services, extreme poverty and material deprivation, gender
      inequalities, and inequalities of income and wealth. The index reveals
      disparities between the regions of Benin &ndash; the southern departments
      close to the economic capital (Cotonou) perform better, and significant
      SDG challenges remain in the north.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      The data used in these analyses come from international sources to
      facilitate comparisons with other ECOWAS countries, as well as from
      national sources for the subnational index. However, as in other
      developing countries, missing data and delays in statistical production do
      not allow timely and accurate measurement of the progress and efforts made
      by Benin. Therefore, our analysis of the government&rsquo;s efforts, in
      terms of public policies and investment, provides additional information
      to assess Benin&rsquo;s performance.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      The 2022 Sustainable Development Report ranks Benin among the countries
      with &ldquo;strong commitment&rdquo; to the SDGs according to our global
      survey of government efforts. The analysis of the Government&rsquo;s
      Action Program (PAG 2021- 2026) through the framework of the &ldquo;Six
      Transformations&rdquo; shows that the PAG coherently targets Benin&rsquo;s
      challenges in achieving the SDGs. The intensification of the
      government&rsquo;s efforts, such as the insurance program for the
      reinforcement of human capital (ARCH) and its program to ensure universal
      access to drinking water in rural areas, will make it possible to
      accelerate the achievement of several SDGs and to &ldquo;leave no one
      behind&rdquo;, including in the most disadvantaged regions of the country.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Similarly, the analysis of the institutional framework for the
      implementation of the 2030 Agenda in Benin has revealed the strong
      institutional capacities for the achievement of the SDGs. Since 2016,
      Benin has appropriated the SDGs to domesticate the goals and adopt a
      coherent development strategy. The country has a cross-cutting
      institutional apparatus and strong political will that could enable it to
      achieve significant results in the years to come.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Furthermore, achieving the SDGs requires large-scale public and private
      investments. Benin must be supported in its resource mobilization to
      achieve the 2030 Agenda. The issuance of the SDG Eurobond by the
      Government of Benin in July 2021 constitutes an important turning point in
      the commitment and means mobilized for the implementation of the 2030
      Agenda.
