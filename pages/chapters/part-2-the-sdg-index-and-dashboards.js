      <Emphasis primary>
        The adoption in 2015 of three major international agreements - the 2030
        Agenda and the SDGs, the Paris Climate Agreement, and the Addis Ababa
        Action Agenda on financing for development - represented major global
        breakthroughs for the international community. For the first time in
        history, all UN Member States agreed on a common set of goals for
        sustainable development (to be achieved by 2030, with mid-century goals
        for the Paris Climate Agreement) and established major principles and
        priorities for their financing. These commitments were made possible
        only through decades of work and advocacy by scientists, experts,
        governments, and civil society. In fact, 2022 marks the 50th anniversary
        of the first world conference on the global environment - the 1972
        Stockholm Conference - and of the release of the landmark report, The
        Limits to Growth (Meadows et al., 1972). Multiple health and security
        crises, amplified by the climate and biodiversity crises, are now,
        however, putting the sustainable development agenda at risk. As the SDG
        Index highlights, since 2019 these crises have halted progress on
        sustainable development worldwide.
      </Emphasis>
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Although too slow, and unequal across countries and goals, progress was
      made globally on the SDGs between 2015 and 2019. But on top of their
      disastrous humanitarian cost, recent health and security crises have
      shifted attention away from long-term goals such as climate action, and
      exposed major fragmentation in multilateralism. These successive crises
      have also hit low-income and vulnerable countries particularly hard, and
      they may take longer to recover due to more limited access to financing.
      Members of the Leadership Council of the SDSN have released a statement
      calling for peace and diplomacy in the context of the war in Ukraine
      (SDSN, 2022).
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Despite these difficult times, the SDGs should remain our roadmap for
      achieving sustainable development by 2030. They remain the only common
      language and vision across all UN member states on the triple bottom line
      of sustainable development: economic, social and environmental. As
      emphasized under SDG&nbsp;16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions) and
      SDG&nbsp;17 (Partnerships for the Goals), peace and diplomacy are absolute
      prerequisites for progress on the goals. It is also crucial we learn from
      the COVID-19 pandemic if we are to prevent and respond in a more
      coordinated way to future outbreaks and pandemics and other major risks,
      as underscored by SDG&nbsp;3 (Good Health and Well-Being). Achieving the
      SDGs is fundamentally an investment agenda, into building physical
      infrastructure and key services, while the bedrock principles of the SDGs
      of social inclusion, global cooperation, and universal access to public
      services are needed more than ever to fight the major challenges of our
      times, including security crises, pandemics, and climate change. Recovery
      plans, notably in high-income countries (HICs), and increased additional
      financing should be mobilized for restoring and accelerating SDG progress.

      In September 2023, the world&rsquo;s heads of state will meet at the
      United Nations in New York for the second SDG Summit since the adoption of
      the 2030 Agenda. The Summit can and must be the opportunity to double down
      on efforts to transform societies by 2030 and beyond.

    <ReportBox number="1" title="The SDG Index and Dashboards">
      <ReportParagraph>
        The SDG Index is an assessment of each country&rsquo;s overall
        performance on the 17 SDGs, giving equal weight to each Goal. The score
        signifies a country&rsquo;s position between the worst possible outcome
        (score of 0) and the target (score of 100). The dashboard and trend
        arrows help identify priorities for further actions and indicate whether
        countries are on-track or off-track based on latest trend data to
        achieve the goals and targets by 2030. Two-thirds of the data come from
        official statistics (typically UN custodian agencies) and one third from
        non-traditional statistics, including research centers, universities,
        and non-governmental organizations. Published since 2015, the SDG Index
        and Dashboards has been peer-reviewed (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2017) and
        statistically audited by the European Commission (Papadimitriou et al.,
        2019). More detailed information is available in the Annex
        (Method&rsquo;s Summary and Data Tables) and on our website
        (www.sdgindex.org).

    <ReportHeading>2.1 Global trends and rankings</ReportHeading>
    <ReportParagraph>
      For the second year in a row, the world was no longer making progress on
      the SDGs in 2021. At 66.0 points, the average SDG Index score declined
      slightly from 2020: the pandemic and other crises have clearly been major
      setbacks for sustainable development.
    </ReportParagraph>

    <ReportParagraph>
      From 2015 to 2019 the world progressed on the SDG Index at an average rate
      of 0.5 points a year. This was already too slow to achieve the SDGs by
      2030. Progress also varied significantly across countries and goals, with
      trends for some countries and on some goals heading in the wrong
      direction. Poorer countries with lower SDG Index scores were progressing
      faster than richer countries. Since 2019, however, SDG Index scores have
      declined slightly: by 0.01&nbsp;points per year on average. Overall,
      progress on the SDG Index has stagnated across all income groups.
    </ReportParagraph>

    />
    <ReportParagraph>
      The decline in the SDG Index score since 2019 has been driven primarily by
      a reversal in progress on socioeconomic goals. SDG&nbsp;1 (No Poverty) and
      SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) have been especially impacted by
      multiple crises in this period. The share of people facing extreme poverty
      has increased significantly since 2019, including in low-income countries
      (LICs). Small Island Developing States (SIDS) are also particularly
      vulnerable to international crises, partly due to their dependence on the
      international trade system, remittances, and tourism.

    <ReportParagraph>
      As recent editions of the{" "}
      <Italics>Sustainable Development Report</Italics> (SDR) have highlighted,
      progress on other SDGs has also been impacted, including SDG&nbsp;2 (No
      Hunger), SDG&nbsp;3 (Health and Well-Being) and SDG&nbsp;4 (Quality
      Education), while temporary gains observed during lockdowns on
      environmental goals in 2020 were rapidly offset once restrictions were
      lifted (IPCC, 2022). The 2020 and 2021 editions of the SDR discussed and
      analyzed in detail the impact of COVID-19 on key SDG metrics (Sachs et
      al., 2020, 2021).
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Due to time lags in data reporting, the full impact of the multiple crises
      including the COVID-19 pandemic is not fully reflected in this
      year&rsquo;s SDG Index. The ramifications that school closures have had on
      learning outcomes, as well as the pandemic&rsquo;s direct and indirect
      effects on health (such as long COVID, mental health impacts, or
      repercussions of delayed interventions and screening), may have long-term
      development impacts that could take years to be fully reflected in
      international statistics. This year&rsquo;s SDG Index also does not yet
      capture the war in Ukraine and its impact on many countries. Other studies
      have already documented the impacts and likely impacts of the war in
      Ukraine on poverty, food security, and other SDGs (FAO, 2022; Wheatley,
      2022; World Bank, 2022c). The impacts of the war in Ukraine, notably on
      access to food and food prices, are amplified by global warming and
      droughts notably in South Asia and other parts of the world.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      The recovery so far has been unequal, and it remains very uncertain.
      During the pandemic, rich countries managed to support emergency and
      recovery expenditures through debt, which helped avoid short-term
      meltdowns, but which are likely to remain visible on balance sheets for
      future generations to deal with. Unemployment rates (covered under
      SDG&nbsp;8, Decent Work and Economic Growth) declined from 2020 levels in
      most high-income countries (HICs) in 2021, whereas they continued to
      increase in LICs &ndash; which do not have the same access to
      international financial markets. The war in Ukraine is also expected to
      contribute to a significant slowdown of economic growth in 2022 and
      beyond. Rising energy prices and disruptions of food supply chains are
      already having a global impact, with vulnerable populations &ndash;
      particularly in LICs &ndash; most affected (IMF, 2022).

    <ReportParagraph>
      As in last year&rsquo;s edition, Finland tops the 2022 SDG Index, followed
      by three other Nordic countries &ndash; Denmark, Sweden and Norway.
      Finland and the Nordic countries are also the happiest countries in the
      world according to the latest World Happiness Report (Helliwell et al.,
      2022). The top ten countries in the SDG Index are all in Europe, eight of
      them members of the European Union. While the detailed dashboards show
      that major SDG challenges remain even in these countries, especially on
      SDGs 12&ndash;15 (related to climate and biodiversity) and in relation to
      international spillovers, the European model of social democracies seems
      conducive to strong performance in the three major dimensions of
      sustainable development: economic, social and environmental.

    <ReportParagraph>
      Low-income countries tend to have lower SDG Index scores. This is partly
      due to the nature of the SDGs, which focus to a large extent on ending
      extreme poverty and providing access for all to basic services and
      infrastructure (SDGs 1&ndash;9). Moreover, poorer countries tend to lack
      adequate infrastructure and mechanisms to manage the key environmental
      challenges addressed by SDGs 12&ndash;15. Yet before the pandemic hit,
      most low-income countries, with the exception of those experiencing
      ongoing armed conflict or civil war, were making progress towards ending
      extreme poverty and providing access to basic services and infrastructure,
      particularly in relation to SDG&nbsp;3 (Good Health and Well-Being) and
      SDG&nbsp;8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). As emphasized in Part 1 of
      this report, we interpret the performance of low-income countries (LICs)
      as a call to action for the world community to scale up SDG finance,
      especially for those countries at the bottom of the ladder.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Overall, East and South Asia has progressed on the SDGs more than any
      other region since their adoption in 2015, with Bangladesh and Cambodia
      showing the most progress of all countries. By contrast, Venezuela has
      declined the most on the SDG Index since 2015.

      2.2 SDG dashboards and trends by income groups and major world regions
    </ReportHeading>
    <ReportParagraph>
      The SDG dashboards highlight each country&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses
      in relation to the 17 goals, presenting performance in terms of levels and
      trends. As described in the methodology section, dashboard ratings for
      each goal are based on data for the two indicators on which the country
      performs worst. Good performance on five of seven indicators, for example,
      does not compensate for poor performance on the other two. In other words,
      our methodology assumes low substitutability or compensation across
      indicators in the construction of our composite index. The arrow system
      focuses on structural trajectories since the adoption of the SDGs (and
      less on year-on-year changes).
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      As in previous years, the dashboards include population-weighted averages
      for each region and income group, using the same set of indicators as the
      SDG Index (Figure&nbsp;2.8). The OECD dashboards (Figure&nbsp;2.9)
      incorporate more indicators than others owing to the greater availability
      of data for these countries. SDSN is also promoting regional editions of
      the SDG Index and Dashboards, including editions on Africa, the Arab
      Region, Europe, and Latin America as well as subnational editions &ndash;
      for instance looking at SDG gaps in cities in Bolivia, Brazil, Italy,
      Spain and the United States. These regional and subnational editions
      further contextualize the indicator selection and discuss more specific
      policy and implementation challenges. For instance, in this global
      assessment, performance on SDG&nbsp;1 (No Poverty) only focuses on extreme
      poverty. In regional editions, we leverage other datasets to track
      material deprivation and poverty below poverty lines. Besides goal-level
      analyses, dashboards showing progress on each indicator are included in
      the country profiles and online database. Table&nbsp;2.2 shows the ten SDG
      targets where high-income and low-income countries are facing the greatest
      challenges and assigns these targets to SDSN&apos;s Six SDG
      Transformations (Sachs et al, 2019).

      title="Major SDG gaps for HICs and LICs by target"
    />
    <ReportParagraph>
      Overall, high-income countries (HICs) and OECD countries are closer to
      achieving the targets than other country groups, yet none are on track to
      achieve all 17 SDGs. These countries perform better on goals related to
      socio-economic outcomes and basic access to infrastructure and services,
      including SDG 1 (No Poverty), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), SDG 6
      (Clean Water and Sanitation), and SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). For
      SDG 3, the indicator set does not capture well a country&rsquo;s
      preparedness for global health security issues (such as pandemics), due to
      the absence of a robust international measure. The additional indicators
      included for OECD countries reveal that, while extreme poverty and basic
      access to services is mostly guaranteed in these countries, gaps persist
      in health and education outcomes across population groups, with income
      inequalities rising in some OECD countries. Further effort is also needed
      to reduce gender pay gaps to achieve SDG 5 (Gender Equality) in many OECD
      countries. Only moderate performance on SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong
      Institutions), is partly driven by high homicide rates in large economies
      (including the United States), but also by persisting issues around access
      to affordable legal services and justice.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Major efforts are needed in HICs and OECD countries to accelerate progress
      towards climate mitigation and biodiversity protection (SDGs 12&ndash;15)
      and move towards more sustainable food systems and diets (covered under
      SDG 2, No&nbsp;Hunger). All HICs and OECD countries generate significant
      negative socioeconomic and environmental impacts outside their borders
      (spillovers) through trade and consumption, hampering other
      countries&rsquo; efforts to achieve the SDGs. Historically these countries
      are also responsible for the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions and climate
      change and hence bear a special responsibility to take actions at the
      national and international level. Yet their progress on SDG 13 (Climate
      Action) and SDG 14 (Life Below Water) is mostly stagnant or insufficient
      to achieve internationally agreed targets.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      HICs and OECD countries have very low levels of undernourishment and among
      the most productive agricultural systems, yet they perform poorly on
      SDG&nbsp;2 (No Hunger) due to high and rising obesity rates and
      unsustainable agricultural systems and diets. Tax havens and
      profit-shifting in some OECD countries continue to undermine the ability
      of other countries to leverage resources to achieve the SDGs.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Overall, poorer countries &ndash; low-income countries (LICs) and
      lower-middle-income countries (LMICs), including many countries in
      sub-Saharan Africa &ndash; as well as Small Island Developing States
      (SIDS) tend to face the largest SDG gaps. This is largely driven by a lack
      of the physical, digital, and human infrastructure (schools, hospitals)
      needed to achieve the socioeconomic goals (SDGs 1&ndash;9) and manage key
      environmental challenges. Ongoing conflicts in some countries have led to
      poor and worsening performance on most SDGs for several years, and the
      pandemic halted years of progress towards eradicating extreme poverty. The
      war in Ukraine threatens access to food globally, including in countries
      already facing major challenges on SDG 2 (No Hunger).
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      By contrast, these countries perform better than the rest of the world on
      SDG&nbsp;12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG&nbsp;13
      (Climate Action). Many of them emit less than 2 tonnes of CO₂ per person
      each year. Yet they are often the countries that are most vulnerable to
      the impacts of climate change. Strengthening public-sector capacities as
      well as statistical capacities remain major priorities in all of these
      countries, as emphasized under SDG&nbsp;16 (Peace, Justice and Strong
      Institutions).

    <ReportHeading>2.3 International spillovers</ReportHeading>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Spillovers, both positive and negative, must be understood, measured, and
      carefully managed. These benefits or costs may be referred to as positive
      or negative externalities. Countries cannot achieve the SDGs if such
      negative externalities from other countries counteract their efforts
      (Schmidt-Traub et al., 2019). International spillover effects are said to
      occur when one country&apos;s actions generate benefits or impose costs on
      another country that are not reflected in market prices and therefore are
      not &apos;internalized&apos; by the actions of consumers and producers
      (Sachs et al., 2017).
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      The 2030 Agenda and the SDGs recognize the importance of international
      spillovers in several crucial ways. SDG&nbsp;17 (Partnerships for the
      Goals) calls for &ldquo;policy coherence&rdquo; for sustainable
      development, SDG&nbsp;12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) stresses
      the need for more sustainable production and consumption, and SDG&nbsp;8
      (Decent Work and Economic Growth) demands the eradication of modern
      slavery and child labor.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Conceptually, international spillovers in the context of the SDGs can be
      grouped into four categories:
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>
        &bull; Environmental and social spillovers embodied into trade.
      </Emphasis>{" "}
      These cover international effects related to pollution, the use of natural
      resources, and social impacts generated by the consumption of goods and
      services. Multi-regional input-output (MRIO) models combined with
      satellite datasets provide powerful tools to track impacts generated
      worldwide by consuming countries. This category of spillovers also
      includes exports of toxic pesticides, trade in waste, and illegal wildlife
      trade. They are particularly connected to SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic
      Growth), SDGs 12&ndash;15 (related to responsible consumption, climate and
      biodiversity) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). They also
      indirectly affect all other SDGs.

      <Emphasis>&bull; Direct cross-border flows in air and water.</Emphasis>{" "}
      These cover effects generated through physical flows &ndash; for instance
      of air and water &ndash; from one country to another. Cross-border air and
      water pollution are difficult to attribute to a country of origin, and
      this remains an important data gap. Unfortunately, the International
      Spillover Index does not currently include any indicators to track these
      types of spillovers. They are particularly related to SDG&nbsp;6 (Clean
      Water and Sanitation) and SDGs 12&ndash;15 on climate and biodiversity,
      but also concern many other goals, including SDG&nbsp;3 (Good Health and
      Well-Being).

      These include unfair tax competition, corruption, banking secrecy, profit
      shifting, tax havens, and stolen assets &ndash; which undermine the
      capacity of other countries to leverage resources to achieve the SDGs.
      They also include positive spillovers (or handprints) such as
      international development finance (for example, ODA). These types of
      spillovers are closely related to SDG&nbsp;16 (Peace, Security and Strong
      Institutions) and SDG&nbsp;17 (Partnerships for the Goals), and indirectly
      to all other SDGs, notably through ODA.

    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>&bull; Peacekeeping and security spillovers.</Emphasis> These
      include negative externalities such as organized international crime or
      exports of major conventional weapons or small arms, which can have
      destabilizing impacts on poor countries. Among the positive spillovers in
      this category are investments in conflict prevention and peacekeeping.
      These spillovers are particularly related to SDG&nbsp;16 (Peace, Security
      and Strong Institutions) and SDG&nbsp;17 (Partnerships for the Goals), but
      also indirectly connected with most of the SDGs &ndash; including poverty,
      hunger, and health, as well as other socioeconomic goals.

      The 2022 International Spillover Index includes 14&nbsp;indicators. Each
      indicator is included in the total SDG Index score, and also used to
      generate a stand-alone International Spillover Index.

      Rich countries tend to generate the largest negative spillover effects,
      undermining other countries&rsquo; efforts to achieve the SDGs. While
      member states of the European Union and many OECD countries top the SDG
      Index and the World Happiness Report, they are among the worst performers
      when it comes to international spillover effects. Approximately 40 percent
      of the European Union&rsquo;s carbon footprint relating to its consumption
      of good and services takes place in other countries (SDSN et al., 2021).

      The European Union&rsquo;s consumption of good and services is responsible
      for 16 percent of the world&rsquo;s tropical deforestation (WWF, 2021),
      its imports of textile products are associated with 375 fatal and 21,000
      non-fatal accidents at work, and its food demand contributes to 16 percent
      of the particulate matter emissions outside its borders (Malik, Lafortune,
      Carter, et al., 2021; Malik, Lafortune, Dahir, et al., 2021). Focusing on
      trajectories: while the European Union has managed to decouple economic
      growth from domestic CO₂ emissions in recent years, there are no signs of
      structural decline in its imported CO₂ emissions (CO₂ emissions generated
      abroad to satisfy EU consumption). Overall, HICs are responsible for more
      than 80% of cumulative imported CO₂ emissions over the period 2010-2018.

      To ensure international legitimacy, the European Union and other rich
      countries must address negative international spillovers, including those
      embodied into unsustainable supply chains. The European Union and its
      member states are taking action. The current President of the European
      Commission has called for &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; of child labor and
      has proposed using trade to export European values throughout the world
      (von der Leyen, 2019). The European Union is developing various
      regulations and tools to strengthen policy coherence and due diligence
      across supply chains. In 2022, Sweden became the first country in the
      world to announce its intention to define a target to reduce consumption-
      based CO₂ emissions (Naturskyddsf&ouml;reningen, 2022).
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      Finland&rsquo;s latest Voluntary National Review (VNR) includes a section
      on measuring and addressing international spillovers (Prime
      Minister&rsquo;s Office of Finland, 2020). Finally, EU technical agencies
      including the Joint Research Centre, Eurostat, and the European
      Environment Agency have developed tools and indicators to monitor
      international spillovers.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      We have identified <Emphasis>four major priority areas</Emphasis> in
      addressing international spillovers:
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>1. SDG Financing:</Emphasis> Rich countries bear a special
      responsibility when it comes to climate adaptation and mitigation and
      safeguarding the Global Commons. They should push for major reforms to the
      international development finance system to support key SDG
      Transformations (see Part 1). In 2021, only five OECD Development
      Assistance Committee member countries (Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg,
      Norway and Sweden) achieved the target of dedicating 0.7 percent of their
      gross national income to official development assistance. Multiple crises
      are putting further pressure on development finance. Rich countries fell
      short too in delivering on their commitment to mobilizing US$100 billion
      each year by 2020 to mitigate further rises in temperature and help poorer
      countries adapt to climate change. Several positive moves were made at
      COP26 in November 2021, including the US and European Union&apos;s pledge
      to slash methane emissions and the European Union&apos;s commitment of
      &euro;1 billion to protect world forests. Rich countries must also lead
      the way in combating illicit financial flows, unfair tax competition, and
      profit shifting &ndash; all of which undermine other countries&apos;
      capacity to leverage resources towards realizing the SDGs. The
      international agreement to implement a global minimum corporate tax rate
      by 2023 is a step in the right direction but will require effective
      implementation.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>2. Technical Cooperation and SDG diplomacy:</Emphasis> Technical
      cooperation and knowledge transfer can support greater sustainability in
      producing countries. In the European Union, SDG/Green Deal diplomacy can
      help to achieve sustainable development worldwide while advancing the
      region&rsquo;s geopolitical interests. It is critical that major
      international infrastructure investment programs &ndash; including the
      United States&rsquo; Build Back Better plan, the European Union&rsquo;s
      Global Gateway strategy, and China&rsquo;s Belt and Road Initiative
      &ndash; align with the SDGs and modernize production systems and
      connectivity in developing countries. Rich countries must leverage
      diplomacy to advance key multilateral processes towards achieving the
      SDGs: at the UN General Assembly, the High-Level Political Forum on
      Sustainable Development, the G7 (under German presidency in 2022), the G20
      (under Indonesian presidency in 2022), and the Annual Meetings of the IMF
      and the World Bank.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>3. National targets and instruments:</Emphasis> In 2022, Sweden
      became the first country to commit to setting a national target to curb
      its imported consumption-based CO₂ emissions. National targets can help
      catalyze action. Due diligence regulations and other monitoring and
      regulatory instruments must be leveraged to hold businesses accountable
      for the impacts generated through their value chains. If well designed,
      measures such as the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism or mirror clauses
      currently under discussion in the European Union could boost policy
      coherence and encourage other countries to align with the European Green
      Deal goals and requirements. Yet these same measures might arguably be
      considered protectionist &ndash; since they will inevitably impact trade
      partners, including poorer countries that are not historically responsible
      for climate change. To counter this, they must be implemented alongside
      increased commitments to international financing and development
      cooperation. Rich countries should also curb trade in waste and toxic
      pesticides and reduce unsustainable consumption, including through
      improved diets and lower material consumption.
    </ReportParagraph>
    <ReportParagraph>
      <Emphasis>4. Accountability, data, and statistics:</Emphasis> Robust data
      systems are paramount at the international, national, industrial, and
      corporation levels: to track negative impacts throughout the entire supply
      chain and to inform global action to address spillovers. Over time,
      consumption-based metrics should become part of official statistics.
      International spillovers must also be included more systematically in
      voluntary national reviews (VNRs) presented by rich countries, following
      the example of Finland.
